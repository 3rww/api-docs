## 3RWW Rainways API

The *3RWW Rainways API* provides a central location for documenting access to the data and processing resources from [3 Rivers Wet Weather](https://www.3riverswetweather.org) and other organizations that are useful for sewer and stormwater modeling in Allegheny County, PA.

The goal of the Rainways API is to provide a shortcut around a lot of the otherwise tedious work of downloading and prepping the environmental, infrastructure, and geophysical data used in sewer and stormwater modeling. It doesn't represent a new database or central repository, only a quicker and more direct way to access existing datastores that are relevant to this kind of work. To that end, it is designed to:

* use and evolve to use the best available data
* be used for locations that you are specifically interested in; it is not meant to be a general purpose data download portal (you can go elsewhere to get the underlying data)

This site should absolutely be considered *beta*; the underlying API specs will almost certainly change.

We've grouped available resources into two categories:

**Data Resources**: These endpoints provide ways to get to geographic and temporal data for points or areas of interest quickly.

**Analysis Resources**: These endpoints derive new information from data resources through further geospatial analysis
